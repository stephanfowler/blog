<p>Globalisation – a Left/Right Liberal Pact</p>
<p>Immigration - the movement of man - is a ageless commonplace. It’s absurd to talk of stopping it. If I were from the Third World, I would do everything to make it to the West, persisting doggedly until I overcame the barriers to entry. I would bring with me my desperation, thus my capacity to work for whatever miserable money is on offer in my host country. This choice – to accept the status of low-paid immigrant – would be rational: I would expect my foreignness to expose me to being a pawn to the interests of others. It would probably be worth it – compared to what I had left behind; my continued presence would be the proof of it. </p>
<p>But mass immigration, however, is a historical particularity. It depends not merely on the emigrant impulse to better one’s lot, but on conditions which cam only be associated with transitional moments in a civilization.</p>
<p>Yet I might also be a pawn in other ways, ones I might be surprised to learn of. In particular, if I were of an ethnicity that had enjoyed mass immigration into the West, I might be appropriated by oddly opposing interests. </p>
<p> Mass immigration is another thing. Immigrants might be demonized by the right, or profited from by the business - but they are equally exploited, ideologically, by the left.</p>
<p>The expansion happens in all directions. A strange thing happens now when a progressive defends mass immigration: he morphs into a capitalist. How many times have we heard that “immigration is good for The Economy”. You’d expect such a claim from the Institute of Directors, but it’s surprising when it comes – as it reflexively does – from the mouth of ostensibly left-leaning folk. Since when was The Economy their god? What happened to their former deity, The Worker? It’s actually straightforward. After the far-left’s cherished internationally proletarian revolt failed to materialise, another international goal was found to replace it: the abolition of national borders. This has crept so far into the mainstream liberalism - as radical ideas do - that it’s now common to hear ostensibly sensible people braying about the need to get rid of nationhood altogether. As long as it fits loosely into the definition of being “against power”, any cause can be used to recruit People of Good Will. </p>
<p> [Link: Brussels no-borders demo]. But more principled leftists – who continued their defence of working-class communities (rather than focus on keep up with radical fashion -  suddenly risked the accusation of “xenophobia”. As the intellegencia’s moral subject and cannon-fodder, The Working Man was eventually dismissed as “The Chav” and abandoned in favour of The Foreigner - who was found to be far more compliant and numerically available. The enemy was also widened accordingly: the evil Hegemon went from being the mere capitalist to the being West itself in all its manifestation. Europe, from theatre of struggle between good and evil, became the “Eurocentric” baddie itself.</p>
<p>“Good for the economy” means lowering of the cost of labour. When wages are low, products are more competitive, profits rise, industry grows faster, shareholders benefit, and corporate tax revenues rise. The inner impulse of the capitalist is to keep costs down, and in almost any industry, labour is by far the greatest cost. Margaret Thatcher had her own recipes for tackling this (destroy the unions, deregulate employment practices). It worked, but it was messy. New Labour’s continued the project in a more underhand way, spinning the globalisation of labour as part of the “Middle Way” dream of a radically liberalised economy producing radical social progress. The result was indeed radical: recent official figures now show that “nearly four out of five new jobs in Britain have gone to foreigners.”<br />

<p>As for losing jobs to China, the effect of labour globalization is to pit a local worker who has gained from over a century’s recognition of his rights, against the cheapest slave to be found abroad. It’s that simple: Europeans cannot compete with China because we are no longer slaves. </p>

<p>(In other words, good for business. i.e. shareholders.)</p>
<p>“There is no longer any discrimination in our embrace of cultural liberalism; it stretches into every nook and cranny of our lives – from the financial markets to sex”<br />

<p>“concerns about Third World overpopulation that were fashionable for the likes of Johnny Carson and Nelson Rockefeller have vanished into the maw of diversity worship. One big reason is the seldom-mentioned but omnipresent alliance between the diversity lobby and the cheap labor lobby.”<br />
