<p>A headline to stop you in your tracks: <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financetopics/financialcrisis/5516536/US-cities-may-have-to-be-bulldozed-in-order-to-survive.html">US cities may have to be bulldozed in order to survive</a>. The article is mostly about Flint - the poorest city on the US:</p>
<blockquote><p>"The obsession with growth is sadly a very American thing. Across the US, there's an assumption that all development is good, that if communities are growing they are successful. If they're shrinking, they're failing." ...</p>
<p>Already, some streets peter out into woods or meadows, no trace remaining of the homes that once stood there.</p></blockquote>
<p>Reads like some some kind of post-civilisation dystopia novel. Sadly, the obsession with growth is probably intrinsic to the continued existence over  hundreds of thousands of years of the human life-form. Survival isn't usually predicated on a will to <em>shrink</em>.</p>
<p>(The picture - unrelated but related - is from a series of <a href="http://www.darkroastedblend.com/2009/01/abandoned-amusement-parks-in-asia.html">abandoned amusement parks in China, Japan, S. Korea and Laos</a>.)</p>
