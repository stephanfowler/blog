<p>The Law exists to send a clear message. Crime is Crime. And yet, there will always be people who simply <em>have</em> to break the rules.</p>
<p>The Public Order Act should have made it quite clear to us all that "interfaith dialogue" is a no-no. But the Vogelenzangs - a couple who run a Liverpool hotel - insisted on indulging their illicit craving:</p>
<blockquote><p>...a conversation arose between the hoteliers and their guest about her faith. It is understood that among the topics debated was whether Jesus was a minor prophet, as Islam teaches, or whether he was the Son of God, as Christianity teaches.<br /><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/religion/6209687/Christian-hoteliers-charged-with-insulting-Muslim-guest.html">Telegraph - 19/09/2009</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Thankfully, the police have stepped in and charged the couple under the 1986 Act. Hopefully - as is very probable - they will be forced to close down their so-called hotel - probably just a "front" for unbridled dialogue and other speech crime.</p>
<p>There's more. I have a hot tip-off for the police: I have discovered, via personal connections at Google, that the practice of Interfaith Dialogue is <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&q=interfaith+dialogue">rife and  widespread</a>. Dedicated organisations exist to engage in it, often in a shamelessly open manner. And it goes all the way up to top: even our <a href="http://www.tonyblairfaithfoundation.org/"> ex-Prime Minister </a> is implicated. Sadly, I expect the police will dismiss these allegations as fantastical.</p>
