<p>That which we aim for is a universalism. That which we resort to is tribalism. The weakness of universalism is that it requires everyone’s participation; it is prone to the first expression of tribalism. Thus I cannot be unilaterally universal. That is why liberalism will eat itself; it does not see that it’s optimism invites its own undoing.</p>
