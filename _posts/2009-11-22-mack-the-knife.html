<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_Bloom">Allan Bloom</a> traces the popular enthusiasm for criminality to the 19th century German philosophers. Culturally - according to him - the new appetite hits the mainstream with "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mack_the_Knife">Mack the Knife</a>" from Brecht's and Weill's The Threepenny Opera, in 1928 Weimar Germany. It was the first time the bourgeoisie could blithely - almost compulsively - sing along to a celebration of murder and degradation. Bloom wrote a few decades later:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our stars are singing a song they do not understand, translated from a German original and having a huge popular success with unknown but wide-ranging consequences, as something of the original message touches something in American souls. But behind it all, the master lyricists are Nietzsche and Heidegger.<br />
(<a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uzd1AAAAMAAJ">The Closing of the American Mind</a> &#8211; p151)</p></blockquote>
<p>Someone described to me the plot of the Cannes Grand Prix winner - the prison drama <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1235166/">Un Proph√®te</a> - with its semi-deification of murder, drug dealing, and tribal identity. Bloom's point immediately came to mind; it always does when pleasant civilised people tell me I simply <em>must</em> see  whatever gritty rendition of the war-of-all-against-all is currently in vogue (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wire">The Wire</a>, etcetera.) </p>
<p>Swept along by the prevailing <em>nostalgie de la boue</em>, I saw the film myself a week later. It presses all the right leftist buttons: the idea that the only crime is to imprison people (Foucault); the nobility of the savage (Rousseau); the sacralisation of other cultures/races (Levi-Strauss) vs. an assumed guilt for ones own (almost all 20th century French thinkers).  </p>
<p>And guess what? The music on the closing "crime pays" redemption scene is... <em>Mack the Knife</em>.</p>
