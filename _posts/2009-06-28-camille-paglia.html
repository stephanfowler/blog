<p>I haven't paid attention to Camille Paglia for about fifteen years. I suppose I had the impression she was a cultural-theory loud-mouth that one could ignore without peril. Mind you, I don't really watch television.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm wrong. These three short <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-per6fs4YdE&videos=57KxndCCKgE&playnext_from=TL&playnext=1">clips of her speaking on the degradation of academic literary studies</a> spurred me to buy her lastest book.</p>
