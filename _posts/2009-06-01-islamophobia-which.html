<p>Race is not a choice, let alone one that requires a defensible moral rationale. Religion, on the other hand, is <em>exactly</em> that.</p>
<p>The opportunity to overlook this distinction is taken up, enthusiastically, whenever a criticism of religious ideology is dubbed as racism. Further obscurantism is supplied by the prevailing confusion over what race is, or isn't, or whether it exists, or not, or... etcetera.</p>
<p>Here’s an example from <a href="http://www.islamophobia-watch.com/">Islamophobia Watch</a> - a source one would expect to show clarity the matter. The site provides (at time of writing) <a href="http://www.islamophobia-watch.com/islamophobia-a-definition/">definitions of Islamophobia</a>, quoting various sources. So:</p>
<blockquote><p>“It is viewed as a new form of racism whereby Muslims, an ethno-religious group, not a race, are nevertheless constructed as a race.”</p></blockquote>
<p>According to this, it’s the Islamophobe who fallaciously "constructs the race". However, further on:</p>
<blockquote><p>“A more accurate expression would be ‘anti-Islamic racism’ for it combines the elements of dislike of a religion and active discrimination against the people belonging to that religion.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, it seems to be the <em>anti</em>-Islamophobe who's at it.</p>
<p>This needs clearing up. Better still, why not just drop the race hot-potato from discussions of ideology. Even in the cases where <a href="http://thesleepwalkofthewest.com/2009/09/the-word-becomes-flesh/">race is itself an effect of ideology</a>, it's the causes that matter.</p>
<p>(The image is of a Polish-born German and convert to Islam, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Ganczarski">Christian Ganczarski</a>. I saw, as a random tourist, an hour or two of the Paris trial for his role in the 2002 bombing of a synagogue in Tunisia.)</p>
