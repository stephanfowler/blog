<p>Strangely, some national anthems (e.g. European ones) are taboo - the mark of supremacist colonialism etcetera, whereas others are encouraged - noble expressions of cultural identity that we should all join in with.</p>
<p>Here is the Algerian national anthem being sung during a <a href="http://www.indigenes-republique.fr/article.php3?id_article=469">demonstration</a> at the end of my street in Paris.</p>
<p><object width="320" height="265"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/raSNCajd0dI&hl=en&fs=1&" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/raSNCajd0dI&hl=en&fs=1&" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="320" height="265"></embed></object></p>
<p>It contains lines such as "we have taken the noise of gunpowder as our rhythm, and the sound of machine guns as our melody". The French sing "may a tainted blood drench our furrows"; and the British "scatter her enemies, and make them fall". Standard martial stuff; the idea being to puff chests and shout who's best. But imagine the liberal-thinking reaction to an ethnically homogeneous crowd of young white men waving the national flag in the Paris streets singing <em>La Marseillaise</em>, or in London chanting God Save The Queen...</p>
<p>The paradox of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiculturalism">multiculturalism</a> is that it shelters a load of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnocentrism">ethnocentrism</a>s, which are innately in opposition to it. (And the paradox of some ethnocentrisms is that they might not be able to even <em>exist</em> outside of a multicultural harbour.)</p>
