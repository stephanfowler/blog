<p>A position once held to be left wing becomes perceived as right wing. Gaullists in France, rebels who found in armed combat to reclaim their nation from the Nazis, are now "Right wing" in the view of today's Left (who effectively deny the legitimacy of the notion of nations, let alone ones worth fighting for).</p>
<p>Thus liberalism has its relentless creep, the ever widening boundary of of ideas that must fall under its accusatory gaze. Everything, in the end, must be classed as oppression.   </p>
<p>That which we aim for is a universalism. That which we resort to is tribalism. The weakness of universalism is that it requires everyone’s participation; it is prone to the first expression of tribalism. Thus I cannot be unilaterally universal. That is why liberalism will eat itself; it does not see that it’s optimism invites its own undoing.</p>
