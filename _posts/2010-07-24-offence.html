<p>Offence is so entertaining:<br />
"Media watchdog Ofcom has received 23 complaints about Syed's storyline - from viewers who said a gay Muslim was offensive to their faith. It is the second time in just over a week the Albert Square soap has prompted complaints on religious grounds. The BBC earlier responded to complaints about the portrayal of murderous EastEnders preacher Lucas Johnson (Don Gilet) after some viewers considered the storyline offensive to Christians."<br />
