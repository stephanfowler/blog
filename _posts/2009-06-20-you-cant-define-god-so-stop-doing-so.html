<p>It's a common position of moderates that you canâ€™t define what God is (e.g. Karen Armstrong near 17:10 in <a href="http://meaningoflife.tv/video.php?speaker=armstrong&topic=whatsgod">this interview</a>).</p>
<p>It seems plausible and consistent for a non-believer to say the gods are undefinable or ill-defined, or to define gods that they don't believe in. But I can think of at least three problems when a believer claims that God can't be defined (apparently this is an "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_theology">apophatic</a>" theology):</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The statement self defeats</strong>. That "you can't define God" is itself an attempt at a definition. It's akin to a relativist argument, and suffers from the weaknesses of such arguments: they either attack themselves, or else exempt themselves from their own attack - inexplicably.</li>
<li><strong>How do you know?</strong> Unless you have a formal proof of unknowability, you're just talking about something that you admit not knowing the half of. That's frowned on, for God's sake.</li>
<li><strong>How do you know, then, that he's worth worshipping?</strong> Given all that 'mystery', he might actually be much less appealing than you think he is.</li>
</ol>
<p>Defining terms, with all its difficulties, is a basic goal of conversation. With moderates, it can feel deeply pointless; God is the topic they insist on, but they withhold all possibility of agreeing terms. Fundamentalists, of course, are happy to define God for you; and with no hangups.</p>
<p>(Added: <a href="http://www.daylightatheism.org/2009/06/the-god-of-shadow-and-vapor.html">Daylight Atheism</a> has a better post than this, on the same subject.)</p>
