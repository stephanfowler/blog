<p>Robert Fisk's automatic need to insist that everyone including the "West" (he seems to deny its existence) is guilty of honour killing - despite then listing only Islam's litany crimes (plus a couple of Sikh and Hindu ones):<br />

<p>This is the relenlesss egalitarianism of liberal thought. All cultures are valid! All people are equal!</p>
<p>Even if honour killing is not a muslim stricture, there are still reasons why it correlates with Islam. Because islam is non secular - thus tribal - it maintains tribal codes and does not encourage civic society.</p>
