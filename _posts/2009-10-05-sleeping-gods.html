<p><a href="http://thesleepwalkofthewest.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/street-prayer-large.jpg"><img src="/assets/street-prayer.jpg" alt="street-prayer" title="street-prayer" width="123" height="123" class="alignright size-full wp-image-1570" /></a></p>
<p>An <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/1f4cf7c4-ad5e-11de-9caf-00144feabdc0.html"> FT article on Islam in France</a> argues that a demographic "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurabia">Eurabia</a>" outcome is unlikely. I agree. However, the article is very optimistic about the piety of the average French Muslim, as well as the societal impact of multi-faith "mélange" (mix). On the first point, it seems to think that the 15 to 20 percent of non-practicing Muslims is a reassuring sign of French secularisation. Hold on... that means 80 to 85 percent <em>are</em> practicing.</p>
<blockquote><p>On a street corner opposite a café, you find an abandoned pair of slippers and steps leading down to one of the cellar “prayer rooms” where most religious Muslims in France pray. The law of 1905 – cementing the separation of church and state – forbids the Republic to pay for religious buildings. In fact, there doesn’t seem to be much demand.</p></blockquote>
<p>I'm not so sure. Maybe the author hasn't been to the Goutte d’Or in the 18th arrondissement on a Friday lunchtime, where <a href="http://thesleepwalkofthewest.com/2009/06/waves-of-faith/">entire streets are blocked by thousands of worshippers</a> because the two local mosques can't meet the demand. And support for a replacement mega-mosque <em>is</em> forthcoming from <a href="http://www.lepoint.fr/actualites-politique/2008-01-04/francoise-de-panafieu-veut-une-nouvelle-mosquee-a-paris/917/0/217235">some politicians of the Republic</a>.</p>
<p>As for the impact of "mélange", Caroline Fourest wrote recently that <a href="http://www.lemonde.fr/archives/article/2009/10/02/retour-de-flamme-anti-islam-par-caroline-fourest_1248391_0.html">France is shifting</a> from a posture of "secularism against extremism" to one of "Christianity against Islam". I've long thought that the real effect of a resurgent Islam is not the Islamisation of the West (even if this is partially true) but the waking of a sleeping dog: the dormant Christianity of the majority - particularly in varying forms of Christian nationalism. If it doesn't feel that way yet, the prevailing minoritarian discourse tends - of itself and by the reactions it provokes - to drown the voice of the plebeian under the primacy accorded to voice of the fringe.</p>
<p>Political correctness is a fragile skin over a swelling boil of unarticulated rivalries. But boils leak, then burst. The end result will be a huge step back from secularism - the weakness of which is <a href="http://thesleepwalkofthewest.com/2009/06/secularism/">its reliance on the good will of everyone</a>, including fundamentalists of all stripes.</p>
