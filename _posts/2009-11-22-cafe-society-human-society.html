<p>Last week a friend and I chatted with two pleasant American women for about an hour, in a café. Afterwards he - an American himself - turned to me and, pointing to where one of the women had sat, asked if I realised who she was. I said no. He said: "Monica Lewinsky."</p>
<p>It wasn't any old joint, mind you. It was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caf%C3%A9_de_Flore">Café de Flore</a>, where JP Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir sat putting the world to rights (or rather to lefts). Their story was also one of idealism colliding with nature. To be a Marxist - as they variously were - is to believe fundamentally in the perfectibility of mankind, in the essential equality and goodness of man, woman, and everything. Nonetheless, Sartre in his actual life makes Bill Clinton look like <em>choirboy</em>, even if his infamous sexual exploitations didn't quite have the geo-political impact of the Clinton-Lewinsky affair. (Alternative global scenario: Al Gore - supported by an untainted Clinton - wins against Bush; the climate change "debate" burns itself out; Sadam Hussein is still in power; the Taliban are running Afghanistan and Pakistan... etcetera.)</p>
<p>At any rate, it's remarkable to meet someone, themselves unremarkable, who so epitomises that it is only our imperfect - but perfectly human - nature that "makes history".</p>
