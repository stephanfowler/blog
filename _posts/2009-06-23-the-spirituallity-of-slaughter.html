<p><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/end-cruel-religious-slaughter-say-scientists-1712241.html">The Independent</a> reports that Government advisers have said religious slaughter techniques practised by Jews and Muslims are cruel and should be ended. (They're referring to animals, BTW.) How about this for an oxymoron:</p>
<blockquote><p>[Religious groups] are granted an exemption to the Welfare of Animals (Slaughter or Killing) Regulations 1995.</p></blockquote>
<p>So much for the meek inheriting the earth. Thankfully, the Independent tells us <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/jerome-taylor-the-beliefs-behind-the-halal-and-kosher-rituals-1712240.html">elsewhere</a> that:</p>
<blockquote><p>[The Sharia method] adds another layer of spirituality to the slaughter by insisting that the slaughterer says the words Bismillah, Allahu Akbar (In the name of God, God is the greatest) as the animal's throat is slit.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, that's reassuring. As long as the gods are placated, <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Py0-68k8U1YC&lpg=PA256&ots=Fzo5vNCLkw&pg=PA614">all things are lawful</a>.</p>
