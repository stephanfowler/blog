<p>If you haven't done so already, the <a href="http://www.elsewhere.org/pomo/">latest article</a> at Communications from Elsewhere is a must-read. Dense, but worth the effort:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Truth is part of the stasis of reality,” says Baudrillard; however, according to Buxton, it is not so much truth that is part of the stasis of reality, but rather the absurdity, and eventually the failure, of truth. </p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Gotcha!!</strong> A new article is generated on-the-fly, each time you <a href="http://www.elsewhere.org/pomo/">hit the page</a>. Pseudo-random is the apt term.</p>
