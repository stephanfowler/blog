<p>The news these last few days seems to belong to our religious leaders and their wrestle for our souls. </p>
<p>The Pope was dramatically <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/vaticancityandholysee/6884712/Pope-Benedict-XVI-delivers-Christmas-message-hours-after-being-attacked.html">thrown to the ground, but immediately bounced back</a>. Muscling in on a defenceless position, the mighty Roman made a quick lunge for all those displaced by "hunger, intolerance or environmental degradation". </p>
<p>The opposition was at it too. In a bid to out-manoeuvre the Jesuits, the Church of England's secret new <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/dec/23/church-recruiting-drive-targets-children">Going for Growth</a> tactic was exposed: to have the Anglican brand delivered to children as young as <em>two</em>. The Archbishop of Canterbury turned theatrically to the crowd and made a <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/religion/6883823/Archbishop-of-Canterbury-children-are-being-made-to-grow-up-too-quickly.html">rousing plea</a>, urging children's dependency on their parents/teachers to be extended, presumably so that they might stay in the re-Christianised ring for as long as possible. (Elsewhere, more Irish bishops <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/religion/6884253/Two-more-bishops-resign-over-Irish-child-sex-abuse.html">resigned over abuse</a>; a little less dependence might have been in order there, you might say.) Meanwhile, the Catholic Church was busy perfecting its own new gambit: <a href="http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_ben-xvi_apc_20091104_anglicanorum-coetibus_en.html">Anglican ambush</a>. </p>
<p>And so on. All petty moves toward a single result: we are being taunted into becoming Christians again. Provoked, by the media's relentless cultural relativism, by Islam-fatigue (see <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article6968218.ece">today's installment</a>), by our growing acceptance of opportunistic Christianity. Even if it takes a couple of centuries, watch as it degenerates to no-holds-barred. </p>
<p>As I turn off the TV, my only thought is: can't these mystagogues in their wrestling capes just leave us alone? For Christmas, at least?</p>
