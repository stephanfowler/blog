<p>The Julian Assange instinct: bring down society in the name of liberty! But no liberal society was built on radial liberalism. Structure is what protects and affords freedom - in so far as people actually want freedom. (Most really prefer security; liberalism is the luxury of a civil society that is necessarily constructed and maintained by arguably illiberal means). Esp. freedom of conscience, the confidence that you can say what you want in private. This is something he himself claims, e.g. on Today programme "I am a private person".</p>
<p>There is, in much political thought, an underlying resentment of the world. A dissatisfaction with what's there, what's given. Truth; Nature; whatever you want to call it. Whenever someone enthuses about "radical change", you can be sure that he thinks he really means it; let's turn the world upside-down! burn it all and start again! </p>
<p>Why? As if it'd end up any different.</p>
<p>Marxism, and and all its derivatives and inheritors,  </p>
<p>William Morris, utopian socialist, in preface to After London (a weird, remarkable, but pessimistic book) talsj of his longing for societal collapse.</p>
<p>The Road - the mawkish hollywood rendition of apocophilia</p>
<p>Apocophilia - an attraction to, or taking pleasure in, end-of-society scenarios, such as global nuclear war, or worst-case peak-oil or global-warming. Often leads to what others would regard as a 'pessimistic' world view, however Apocophiliacs often identify with an 'up-side' to the total destruction of mostly everything. Proof of irrationality can often be found in a belief that they will survive the impending apocolyse themselves.<br />

<p>Melanie Phillips on Utopias.<br />
"when utopias fail, as they always do, their adherents invariably select scapegoats on whom they turn to express their rage over the thwarting of the establishment of that perfect society. And since utopia is all about realising the perfect society, these scapegoats become enemies of humanity."<br />

<p>Nihilism.</p>
<p>Racist Mathematics. Also:<br />
" mathematics is both value-laden and culture-base... We need to ask how we could view mathematics differently to reveal power structures within it, what counts and who counts it,.. We could ask, for example, why abstract ideas such as algebra, long division (both linked to privileged pure mathematics practices) and analogue time are included in current curricula but ideas about odds (linked to betting shops), and the geometry of buildersâ€™ numeracy practices, are excluded: that is what counts and who counts it!!   This is not to say that algebra is not beautiful or powerful, but we need to know why it is included and how it impacts on social discrimination."<br />

The bankruptcy of the "communist idea" and the examples in the mond Zizcek, Qutb, Sun Ra.<br />
We don;t want "emancipatory politics" That is tyranny,<br />
http://www.bbk.ac.uk/bih/activities/ideaofcommunism</p>
<p>"The communist hypothesis remains the good one, I do not see any other," said Badiou, in his foreword to the conference programme. "If we have to abandon this hypothesis, then it is no longer worth doing anything at all in the field of collective action. Without the horizon of communism, without this idea, there is nothing in the historical and political becoming of any interest to a philosopher. Let everyone bother about his own affairs, and let us stop talking about it... what is imposed on us as a task, even as a philosophical obligation, is to help a new mode of existence of the hypothesis to deploy itself."<br />
