<p>The Girl Who Played with Fire<br />
Every man is a rapist (apart from a couple of fight-on journalists). Only transgressive lesbian tattoo-defaced girls are morally justified.<br />
Four Lions:</p>
<p>"The idea that terrorists must be fools belongs alongside other reassuring lies that we tell our children, such as "all bullies are cowards". Grownups who take refuge in it aren't striking a bold blow against an unnecessarily puffed-up enemy; they're deluding themselves... Four Lions might have been more amusing if it had made fun of the Qur'anic verses on which jihad is supposed to be founded. Yet religious matters are discreetly avoided, just as they were in The Infidel."<br />

<p>The Indifel</p>
<p>White Material - white people are obsolete; a film dedicated to the young child rebels who randomly pillage and kill.</p>
