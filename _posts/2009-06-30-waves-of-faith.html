<p>The Al Fath Mosque on Rue des Poissonniers in Paris receives thousands for Friday prayer, way beyond its capacity. The surrounding streets are entirely given over to worshippers.</p>
<p>Around the corner is the vast church of St Bernard de la Chapelle, whose doors appear to be permanently padlocked. Amongst local proposals is that of converting the church into a mosque. I'd hazard a guess that this is not what was - during the French Revolution - envisaged by "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dechristianisation_of_France_during_the_French_Revolution">dechristianisation</a>".</p>
<p>(The photo of the prayers is mine. The church is from Google Street View.)</p>
