<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coventry_Cathedral">Coventry Cathedral</a> is one of those rare examples of successful Modernism, whose appeal transcends architectural fashion. Like another successful example &#8211; the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbican_Estate">Barbican Estate</a> &#8211; it rose from the devastation of the German Luftwaffe, and now overlooks its previous incarnation, a crumbling, unrestored symbol of 20th Century cataclysm.</p>
<p>As a result of this traumatic history, the focus of the cathedral is "world peace"; it has its International Center for Reconciliation; its <a href="http://www.coventrycathedral.org.uk/about-us/our-reconciliation-ministry/the-community-of-the-cross-of-nails.php">Cross of Nails</a> talisman. Just inside the entrance, when I visited, was a travelling exhibition by the <a href="http://www.theforgivenessproject.com/">Forgiveness Project</a> displaying <a href="http://www.theforgivenessproject.com/stories/">stories</a> of forgiveness in spite of horrific personal tragedy. These were deeply moving and compelling. But whereas the exhibition&#8217;s presence was intended, surely, to imply that forgiveness has a particularly Christian warrant, in keeping with Anglican sheepishness nothing of the sort was claimed. God forbid!</p>
<p>In contrast, leaflets were on offer to promote <a href="http://www.westmidlandsifw.org.uk/home2/index.php/events-calendar/midlands/66-coventry">Interfaith Week</a> &#8211; featuring the indispensable Spiritualists and Bahá'ís (who seem to exist primarily in order to attend <a href="http://thesleepwalkofthewest.com/2009/11/gods-help-us-2/">such events</a>), orientated in particular to a "Discover Islam" exhibition, and replete with reminders to "bring something to cover your head."</p>
<p>As with many good intentions of postwar compassion and goodwill, the clear modernity of Coventry cathedral has drifted over the decades into the opaque waters of postmodernity, and adopted that self-negating instinct &#8211; in the words of G K Chesterton &#8211; to praise every creed except its own. As a thought experiment, you might ask yourself what kind of, ahem, <em>place of worship</em> would be built next to its ruins if a bomb was to fall on it again, today...</p>
