<p>It's official! The stylists of the French Senate, after a protracted squabble over what should/shouldn't be accepted as French fashion, have <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article6999909.ece">announced</a>:</p>
<p><strong>Out</strong>: Burkas.<br />
<strong>In</strong>: Hair Shirts.</p>
<p>Don't bin your burka yet though; you can still wear it on the boulevards - it's hipper than ever - only not on public transport or when picking up the kids from school. And that's only a tip - not a law. Yet.</p>
<p>But as for the hair shirt... go girl! Don't hold back. The Senate stylists, feeling guilty after bitching about poor burkas (of which "<a href="http://www.lefigaro.fr/actualite-france/2009/09/09/01016-20090909ARTFIG00040-deux-mille-femmes-portent-la-burqa-en-france-.php">only 367 are worn in France</a>"), want to atone by offering a matching "hair of the dog" <a href="http://abonnes.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2010/01/22/voile-integral-une-vingtaine-de-preconisations-aux-implications-diverses_1295219_3224.html">pamper pack</a> - free! - including:</p>
<ul>
<li>a Bank Holiday for Eid.</li>
<li>a National Institute for Islamic Studies.</li>
<li>an "Islamophobia" comission.</li>
</ul>
<p>Clever fashionistas will immediately spot the imported British style. The cure for too much Islam? <em>More</em> Islam. The UK has set the trend for launching new Islamic centres and organisations to "combat extremism" - having with dizzying rapidity become an <a href="http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-23433081-government-renames-islamic-terrorism-as-anti-islamic-activity-to-woo-muslims.do">authority</a> on "true" Islam. (Haven't they heard of "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essentially_contested_concept">essentially contested concepts</a>"?) </p>
<p>So you can understand why moderate Muslims are reluctant to openly bitch about their fundamentalist co-religionists. There's just <em>too much</em> to be gained by the latter's provocative little fashion statements. A bad week for burkas, but a great week for Islam.</p>
