<p><a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HKLbhAG8ma4C&dq=whittaker+chambers+witness&source=gbs_book_other_versions_r&cad=2"><em>Witness</em></a> - the autobiography of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whittaker_Chambers">Whittaker Chambers</a>’  - is the dramatic story of a Dostoevskian “lesser man” seeking redemption through suffering and rigorous moral integrity. It is a verbose but remarkable book, centering on his personal pendulum-swing from a tortured, austere, and passionately felt Communism - towards an equally tortured, austere, and passionately felt Christianity.</p>
<p>His journey is interesting on various levels, one being the way it contributes to the argument over whether 20th Century atrocities <a href="http://wiki.ironchariots.org/index.php?title=20th_century_atrocities"> constitute an argument against atheism</a>. A counter argument, for example, claims that the eschatological nature of a Communist utopia - as humanity's ultimate destiny - is in fact a genre of metaphysical paradise - a "heaven on earth". Equally, the Final Solution of the Nazis. </p>
<p>In other words, the 20th Century ideologies that led to these appalling atrocities, in important respects, <em>are</em> faiths.</p>
<p>Whether or not this is a coherent argument, it's something else to hear it from the horse's mouth - from someone who was both a devout Communist (who gave himself to the Soviet underground in pre-war America, to espionage and a life in the shadows), then later a devout Christian (who after a spell at <em>Time</em> magazine gave himself to redemptive toil, farming the land as a pious and quasi-mystical Quaker). </p>
<p>In both the "Evil" then the "Good" chapters of his life, his deepest sentiment is identical - a desperate concern for mankind's salvation in dark times. In both cases, this leads to an avowed leap of faith regarding man's ultimate perfectibility - his final "goodness". Chambers, throughout the book, characterizes his entire pilgrimage as a struggle between <em>two faiths</em>.</p>
