<p>I cracked. I just <em>had</em> to do it. Desperate, to cling to something tangible, to some proof that it hadn't been a demonic prank, or glimpse into the echoing abyss...</p>
<p>I bought the catalogue for the <a href="http://thesleepwalkofthewest.com/2009/03/more-less-is-not-more/"><em>Voids</em> exhibition</a>.</p>
<p>Now the 500 page black hole sits there on my table, inert, ignoring me. Gingerly approaching the perilous edge, I've read a few paragraphs - but I'm scared of falling in. I think I'll hide it somewhere and just try to forget. It might be a useful exhibit one day, when I'm on trial for Reactionary Bourgeois Philistinism. I'll be able to point, screaming wildly: <em>it was THAT what did it!</em></p>
<p>Steven Pinker said in <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yhLH4_jQ2iMC&ei=kmLHSrKmEY7-zQT43pWBBA">The Blank Slate</a>: "Art works because it appeals to certain faculties of the mind". In other words, when art <em>doesn't</em> work, it's because it doesn't appeal to any faculty of the mind.</p>
<p>Actually, we do have a faculty for abject nothingness: it's called <em>death</em>. But rank nihilism is not something to be exalted, however thick the glossy brochure.</p>
