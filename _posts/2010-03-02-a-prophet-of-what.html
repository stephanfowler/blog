<p>French cinema is the high-visibility indicator of a great country's cultural hara-kiri. Awards ceremonies are always fundamentally political, but in France they're actually... fundamentalist. After winning at Cannes last years, the film <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1235166/">A Prophet</a></em> was fawned over at the Césars, with no less than nine awards. Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best... etcetera. </p>
<p>The film celebrates the "rise" and deification of an illiterate petty criminal. It's an extremist vision of emancipation: Europe (represented by the Corsican Mafia and the prison screws) is a waning and thoroughly racist Old Guard, virtually a minority in a society (the prison) dominated by observant Islamists, in which to flourish is to claim one's racial origin (the hero's switch to an Arab rather than a French allegiance), and in which to gain respect is to conquer (through murder and a large-scale drug cartel), with a little help from the Koran (via a handy spiritual guide and former murder victim).</p>
<p>Of course - as everyone keeps telling me - it's "really well made". (So what? So was <a href="http://thesleepwalkofthewest.com/2010/01/the-joy-of-guilt/">Avatar</a>. So were the gas chambers.) But it's not even that it is so remarkably anti-Western that is so remarkable; it's the fact of being so roundly lauded by the well-meaning cultural class. The worst thing about the new extremism is not the thing itself, but the adoration it receives within the society it is destroying. I becomes its <em>cause celebre</em>. As I wrote in a <a href="http://thesleepwalkofthewest.com/2009/11/mack-the-knife/">earlier post</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>[A prophet] presses all the right leftist buttons: the idea that the only crime is to imprison people (Foucault); the nobility of the savage (Rousseau); the sacralisation of other cultures/races (Levi-Strauss) vs. an assumed guilt for ones own (almost all 20th century French thinkers).</p></blockquote>
<p>Strangely, the film is apparently exempt from any criticism of racial stereotyping. If I was a Muslim, I bet I'd be a little offended at the example it offers for making friends and influencing people in the West. Not to mention the use of the word <em>Prophet</em> - in such a non-peaceful context...</p>
<p>As for the implied "prophesy", are we supposed to lament it? Or laud it? The ending clearly suggests the latter. The French forgot to give <em>A Prophet</em> a bonus well-deserved award at the Césars: Best Suicide Note of The West.</p>
