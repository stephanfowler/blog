<p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturepicturegalleries/6244256/Pop-Life-Art-In-A-Material-World-at-Tate-Modern-in-London.html?image=7"><img src="/assets/dead-horse.jpg" alt="dead-horse" title="dead-horse" width="123" height="123" class="alignright size-full wp-image-1647" /></a></p>
<p>According to the <a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/modern/exhibitions/poplife/">Pop Life exhibition at Tate Modern</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Andy Warhol claimed "Good business is the best art." Tate Modern brings together artists from the 1980s onwards who have embraced commerce and the mass media to build their own 'brands'.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hmm. I was under the misconception that "good business" was Coke, Microsoft, De Beers, Haliburton, etcetera. And that "the best art" was that which evoked the pre-existing, the transcendent, the pre-eminent, the human, the natural, the spiritual, the glorious, the tragic... something more, at least, than just <em>the successful</em>. We've seen all this art a thousand times already - by definition. It's a dead horse well flogged, and a dishearteningly cruel pretext - the celebration of pure <em>might</em>. </p>
<p>(Talking of which, Nietzsche - that proponent of cruelty and might - allegedly saw a horse flogged in a Turin square, collapsed in a compassionate embrace around the wretched beast's neck, went insane, then died. If Nietzsche can't get it right, why should you listen to Andy Warhol?)</p>
