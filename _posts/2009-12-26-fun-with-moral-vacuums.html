<p>The BBC's moral relativism is epitomised by this joke on Radio 4's <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00pd6hr/The_Now_Show_Series_29_Episode_5/">The Now Show</a> (iPlayler, 12:23):</p>
<blockquote><p>"What's the difference between nuclear proliferation in Iran, and nuclear proliferation in the US?" </p>
<p>(Prolonged silence.)</p>
<p>"Exactly!"
</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh, isn't that good. Ha. Unbridled hilarity aside, what <em>is</em> the difference? Let's see... one wants to use military might to impose democracy/capitalism across the globe; the other wants to use military might to wipe entire races/religions off the globe. </p>
<p>Even if both sides fail in their projects, or already have, or are both objectionable, there's still no argument for an equivalence between the two. To claim that there <em>is</em>, is the same as claiming that you don't mind which side wins out in this geo-politcal struggle. If that's the case, it's an alarming statement for the BBC to endorse. If it isn't, it's a dumb and bankrupt thing to say.</p>
<p>Either way, not worthy of the glib laugh it received. There's something uncomfortable about State-funded humour; it's a great vehicle for unnoticed ideology. </p>
