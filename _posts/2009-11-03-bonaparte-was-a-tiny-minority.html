<p>I respect <a href="http://news.google.co.uk/news?q=Anjem%20Choudary">Anjem Choudary</a>. You basically know where you are with him. He's not a Politician - i.e. someone who knows that they don't mean what they say. Nor is he a Moderate - someone who doesn't know that they don't really mean what they say. Choudary, I think, means <em>exactly</em> what he says. And he says it like it's written in his <a href="http://quod.lib.umich.edu/k/koran/">Book</a> - so you can go and check it afterwards </p>
<p>As for his insignificance, I'm not sure. There is much placed on the reassuring idea that extremists - because they represent "only a tiny minority" - are therefore somehow not something to worry about; that they are "not representative". This is wishful thinking. All great political change or upheaval is precisely the work of a "tiny minority" - often of a single charismatic person. The world-views of Bonaparte, Lenin, Ataturk, etcetera - and their little cliques - could hardly be described as having been "representative" even in the most pivotal moments of their ascent to power. </p>
<p>Humans - being animals - have a strong taste for hierarchy. The vulgar majority "falls in" with the self-organising order. The tip of the power-pyramid is rarely more than the tiniest of groups. And by virtue of his particularity, the leader himself is extremist; he is at that extreme position of command precisely because of his extremist will to power. </p>
<p>The comforting idea that democracy - with its brute majoritarian inertia - guards against all this, is false. Or, true only in a secondary sense: being a mechanism for the eventual removal of leaders. (Though not guaranteed: democracy is easily be cancelled by the incumbent, Hitler-style ). Liberal democracy does nothing to prevent the rise of extremists. If anything it encourages them; it offers them a self-legitimizing path to power, while actually <em>cherishing</em> their freedom from suppression.</p>
<p>Even if Choudry is completely implausible (apart from his absurd ideology being inadmissible in a country like the UK, he just isn't enough of a <em>politician</em>), the fact we don't stop seeing him in the media shows how a "tiny minority" can make a disproportionately huge impact on the mainstream. </p>
<p>Thankfully, at least Choudry is honest enough to say exactly what he has planned for us. All good reasons to prefer him, for instance, to certain other <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Tariq+Ramadan">Fashionable Islamic Scholars</a>.</p>
