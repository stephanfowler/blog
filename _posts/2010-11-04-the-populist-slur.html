<p>Revulsion at the Tea Party as an instance of the use of populist as a slur on the people. The intellectuals' reflex to know the truth, whereas the people are the truth, like it or no. The anti-democratic ness of this. The pedigree of Chomsky'esque   appropriations of what is right for "the people".</p>
