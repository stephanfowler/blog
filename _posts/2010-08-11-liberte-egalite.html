<p>"propriété manifeste l’inégalité mais est l'objet même de la liberté, le machinisme accroît la productivité mais détruit l’artisanat et soumet le salarié, in fine la liberté elle-même est à la fois indispensable mais cause de l'inégalité"<br />
http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Joseph_Proudhon</p>
<p>"Property is the exploitation of the weak by the strong. Communism is the exploitation of the strong by the weak. ....<br />
In communism, inequality springs from placing mediocrity on a level with excellence. This damaging equation is repellent to the conscience, and causes merit to complain; for, although it may be the duty of the strong to aid the weak, they prefer to do it out of generosity, — they never will endure a comparison. Give them equal opportunities of labor, and equal wages, but never allow their jealousy to be awakened by mutual suspicion of unfaithfulness in the performance of the common task.<br />
Communism is oppression and slavery. Man is very willing to obey the law of duty, serve his country, and oblige his friends; but he wishes to labor when he pleases, where he pleases, and as much as he pleases. He wishes to dispose of his own time, to be governed only by necessity, to choose his friendships, his recreation, and his discipline; to act from judgment, not by command; to sacrifice himself through selfishness, not through servile obligation. Communism is essentially opposed to the free exercise of our faculties, to our noblest desires, to our deepest feelings.<br />
