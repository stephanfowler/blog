<p>Much has been written these last few days on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_L%C3%A9vi-Strauss">Claude Lévi-Strauss</a>. <em>Le Monde</em> devoted <a href="http://www.lemonde.fr/web/recherche_resultats/1,13-0,1-0,0.html?dans=dansarticle&num_page=1&booleen=et&ordre=pertinence&periode=30&sur=LEMONDE&query=strauss&x=0&y=0">four pages</a> to the Grandfather of Anthropology, who has died aged 100. In an odd irony - after reams of praise for his insights into ethnographic diversity and the rich taxonomy of humankind - an unrelated <a href="http://www.lemonde.fr/cgi-bin/ACHATS/acheter.cgi?offre=ARCHIVES&type_item=ART_ARCH_30J&objet_id=1105137">article</a> in the same paper describes how shocking it is that some French companies have been discovered - by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOS_Racisme">SOS Racisme</a> - to be compiling statistics on employee ethnicity. </p>
<p>This is illegal in France since the 1978 law banning any collection of such stats in either public or private sectors - to discourage the disintegration of French culture into multiculturalism (a negative term, there). Hold on: Lévi-Strauss was French and he did precisely that: he collected data on ethnicity.</p>
<p>And in Britain, it is standard policy in both public and private sectors to do so - in order to monitor the success of multiculturalism (a positive term, there). But hold on! Some black people <a href="http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23763727-pub-bill-called-us-black-when-we-were-only-couple-dining.do">object to</a> being called "black people". </p>
<p>A funny business, race. Seems that only certain people have the privilege of acknowledging it. Hey, isn't that... racist?</p>
