<p>During the <a href="http://thesleepwalkofthewest.com/?p=172">same</a> Paris <a href="http://www.indigenes-republique.fr/article.php3?id_article=469">demonstration</a>, placards were handed out showing historical icons of resistance to oppression. Mohamed Ali, Arafat,<br />
ML King, Sitting Bull... though the accompanying chants were only about contemporary objects of love/hate. Love: Hamas. Hate: Sarkozy. Strangely, Obama wasn't mentioned.</p>
<p><a href="http://thesleepwalkofthewest.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/placards-big.jpg"><img src="/assets/placards.jpg" alt="placards" title="placards" width="400" height="274" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-240" /></a></p>
<p>On a nearby wall was this (unrelated) sticker:</p>

<p>I do not dispute the grievance of the protest - the 1945 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sétif_massacre">Sétif massacre</a> in Algeria - nor the anti-Nazi cause of <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/causes/136992?recruiter_id=11989072">Lets Fight White Pride</a>. But as with the <em>proudly</em> sung <a href="http://thesleepwalkofthewest.com/?p=172">anthem</a>, it raises difficult side-questions. Which ethnicities are allowed to be proud? Does multiculturalism apply its tolerance equally? What is the duty-of-tolerance between the different groups in a multiculture?</p>
<p>The problem with the increasing sacralisation of ethnicity is that you end up with competing expressions of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_nationalism">ethnic nationalism</a>. Imagine how ugly politics would look if the parties were delineated on ethnic lines. Actually you don't need to imagine, because that's exactly what the British National Party are <a href="http://www.searchlightmagazine.com/index.php?link=template&story=155">doing in the UK</a>.</p>
