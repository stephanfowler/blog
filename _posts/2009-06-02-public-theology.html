<p><a href="http://www.theosthinktank.co.uk/">Theos</a>, the Christian “public theology think tank”, has published <a href="http://www.theosthinktank.co.uk/Four_in_ten_people_believe_in_ghosts.aspx?ArticleID=3015&PageID=14&RefPageID=5">yet another survey</a>. They are quite keen on this radically democratic method of establishing truth. Here they seem to want to imply - while avoiding the risks of actually saying so - that because more people believe in ghosts than did so in the 1950’s, the case for the existence of ghosts (thus the supernatural, thus God, etcetera) has dramatically strengthened:</p>
<blockquote><p>The poll of over 2,000 people… shows that… Almost four in 10 (39%) of people believe in ghosts, 22% believe in astrology or horoscopes, 27% believe in reincarnation and 15% believe in fortune telling or Tarot… The comparison with the 1950s is especially striking. In 1950, only 10% of the public told Gallup that they believed in ghosts, and just 2% thought they had seen one. In 1951, only 7% of the public said they believed in predicting the future by cards and 6% by stars.</p></blockquote>
<p>Perhaps the data does reflect a real increase of ghosts of three hundred and ninety percent since 1950. This is indeed an alarming discovery, for which we must be grateful to Theos.</p>
<p>Hold on, I get it now. This is what Theos means by “public theology”. In order to resolve those difficult questions about life, man, and universe, you really only need a good focus group.</p>
